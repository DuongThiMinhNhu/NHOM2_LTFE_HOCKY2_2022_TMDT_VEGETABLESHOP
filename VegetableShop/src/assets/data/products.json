      "description": " Cabbage Red Organic \n Red or purple cabbages take longer to mature, so these types are generally not as tender as green or white varieties. Red cabbage can be used interchangeably in most standard cabbage recipes but be aware that the colour will leach into any other ingredients. They add a striking addition to coleslaw and traditional salads. It provides a good source of vitamin C and dietary fibre. \n  It utilises organic farming to ensure production involves much more than not using chemical pesticides and fertilisers. This helps to minimise any negative impacts on the environment, maintaining biodiversity of the ecosystem whilst also delivering a nutritious product.   ",

      "description": " Spiral Foods - Organic Shiitake Mushrooms \n  Our shiitake mushrooms are of the highest quality and grown outdoors on oak logs, without chemicals and added flavours. Known as the ‘elixir of life’ since ancient times, shiitake mushrooms contain a rich amount of minerals and B Vitamins. Donko is a type of shiitake that grows slowly in the cold season and is gathered when its top is 60%-80% opened. Due to the long growth period it leaves the Donko Shiitake with soft texture, rich flavour and aroma. Dried Shiitake are easy to prepare, soak in warm water or add straight into soups or stews. When soaked, use liquid as its full of flavour.  \n  Soak in warm water before using or ad straight to your soups.  \n  Organic  \n  Vegan  \n   Ingredients:  Organic Shiitake mushroom (100%)  \n   Storage:  After opening, store in a cool, dry place or store in fridge/freezer  ",

      "description": " Tomatoes Roma or Tomatoes Egg \n  Roma Tomatoes - also know as egg tomatoes.  \n Roma tomatoes are a red and firmer-skinned tomato with a sweet, juicy flesh, used both fresh and for processing. They tend to be oblong in shape (hence the nickname egg tomatoes) and heavy for their size. Usually they are dearer than gourmets. They are highly nutritious, sweet and delicious due to their natural sugars content; sucrose and fructose. They are a good source of vitamin C and supply some vitamin E, folate and dietary fibre. \n  HOW TO PICK   Select those which are bright red for immediate use.    HOW TO STORE   Ripen and store at room temperature until they are brightly coloured and slightly soft. We do not encourage refrigerating tomatoes as it will reduce the flavour and ability to ripen well.  ",

      "description": " Navel Oranges Imperfect Pick \n SPOTTY ORANGES \n We’ve all suffered through a spotty day or two, so we know it’s only skin deep. These frost bitten navels are out of the Riverina district’s bumper season and are super sweet on the inside. Perfect for juicing. \n Navel Oranges have thicker skin and are easy to peel. Their sections peel apart easily, and they have a sweet, juicy flesh bursting with citrus flavour. They are perfect on their own as a snack or juice them for some fresh juice. They provide a good source of vitamin C and a useful source of folic acid and dietary fibre. \n  IMPERFECT PICKS  is our seasonal range of fruit and vegetables that might not look perfect from the outside, but are as perfect as ever on the inside. IMPERFECT PICKS helps reduce the astonishing statistic that 25% of farmers crops currently never leave the farm gate simply because they are a bit ugly, and do not meet the visual specifications of some consumers and supermarkets (Horticulture Australia).This means that every time you buy an IMPERFECT PICK you will be helping us take more of the farmer’s crops, helping reduce food wastage, and most importantly saving up to 50%.  \n   ",

      "description": " Byron Bay - Ginger Necktar \n GINGER NECKTAR Drinks are made with passion - and we are just as passionate about what we put in them . All our ingredients come to us fresh, raw and unprocessed - most of them are sourced directly from local farms. This ensures you can enjoy both optimal freshness and nutritional value.  Every ingredient is inspected for quality and freshness and only those that pass these tests are then juiced, mixed and bottled by hand, in our purpose built factory in Byron Bay.  As our drinks are not mass produced, there are no short cuts, ensuring we provide the freshest and healthiest drinks possible. Why do we go to all this trouble? - because we love to make the Necktars that you love to drink. \n ------------------------------------------------- \n  FRESH GINGER  \n  LEMONS  \n  FRESH WATER  \n  RAW UNPROCESSED HONEY  \n ALL TOGETHER these ingredients combine to provide our uniquely refreshing and healthy fresh drinks. They are NOT treated with heat or infra red to extend their shelf life. Our drinks are best consumed within four weeks of their manufacture, with the expiry date stamped on each bottle. We achieve this shelf life without any hidden processing because the ingredients work in synergy to preserve each other. For example, Lemon juice has been known as a natural preservative and Honey as a natural antiseptic.  FRESHNESS is assured, as every ingredient is hand processed in a single day's production. Everything that goes in to our drinks is juiced or mixed on the very same day it is bottled. ",
