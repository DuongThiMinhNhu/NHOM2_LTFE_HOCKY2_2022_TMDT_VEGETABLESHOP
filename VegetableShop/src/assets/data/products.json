      "description": " Bravo Apples Lunch Box  \n Their unique burgundy skin sets them apart on shelf. Their sweet and juicy flavour mean they are rated as Australia’s best tasting apples. With 25% more flavonoids than other Australian apples, not only are they excellent for your health, but unlike other apples, their flesh is ultra slow to turn brown. This makes them perfect for lunchboxes, fruit platters, snacks, desserts, indecisive toddlers and so much more.  Bravo™ apples are proudly grown by more than 80 growers across Western Australia, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Victoria. \n ------------------------------------------------------------------   Why is a Bravo™ Apple Different?   Bravo™ apples are the product of the world’s most successful apple breeding program in Australia. It has been developed to be outstanding on all fronts – from its dark good looks to its distinctive flavour and texture. You can recognise a Bravo™ apple by its:  \n \n Distinctive dark burgundy skin \n Great crunch and texture \n Sweet juiciness \n Vibrant white flesh \n Slowness to brown \n Long life storage and freshness \n \n ------------------------------------------------------------------   Longer Lasting    Legendary apple breeder John Cripps created the Bravo™ by (naturally) cross breeding two popular apple varieties. We’re proud to be GM free!  One of the benefits of this, was the creation of a brand new genetic profile for Bravo™ apples. This new profile means that Bravo™ apples are very hardy when transported and have excellent shelf life when stored. \n  ",

Carl Jung de-alcoholised wines use a process patented in 1908 that closely retains the taste and characteristics of wine but removes most of the alcohol. \n The process of gently removing the alcohol is currently accomplished by the modern technique of vacuum distillation. These are originally made as traditional fermented alcoholic wines and then have been de-alcoholised, therefore, they are still considered “wine.” These do not taste exactly the same as alcoholic wines, but can be enjoyed with or without a meal as a pairing or in situations where you may want to experience a product similar to wine. \n  A beautiful rich pink wine with a slightly pettillant taste. Good nose with a medium finish. Served chilled it would be a perfect Summer drink. A delicate fruit flavour and would go well partnered with your favourite cheese and light pate.  \n  Tasting notes:    Light-bodied, aromatic nose with notes of strawberry and rhubarb, quite a dry finish ",

Raised without antibiotics with no added hormones and no added growth promotants. \n At Lilydale, chickens are raised by farmers who really care about their welfare. They are fed a nutritious diet and – once adequately feathered at around 21 days – can leave their barns during daylight hours and access fenced outdoor range areas, shade huts, hay bales and ramps. Many chickens are content with the comforts of their barn but during an average day and dependent on conditions like the weather, some chickens will venture out and return at their leisure. Their commitment to free range farming as helped us to provide Australians with quality, great tasting chickens since 2002.  - Raised without Antibiotics. - No added hormones. - No added growth promotants. - Australian grown. \n ------------------------------------------------------------  This product is variable weight.

      "description": " Bk Wines Gower Pinot Noir \n  Adelaide Hills, SA  \n Musk, rose &amp; florals on the nose, making way to black cherry &amp; Chinese spice notes. This wine is beautifully delicate, with some complex aromatics and grainy tannin, supporting the ripe fruit upfront. 25% French Oak, unfiltered, unfined. \n Oh, Gower… Swaby Chardonnay’s elegant other half who always knows his mind. 2018 was a year of ‘masculine’ characters across all of our varietals – leaving aside wafting perfumes to cooler vintages – a profile that suits Gower to a tee.  Musk and undergrowth on the nose Morello cherries, exotic spices and white pepper on the palate with great tannic structure. A handsome balance between finesse and power – broad shoulders and a slim waist. With a nod to European styling, this wine is all clarity of purpose and no apologies. \n  100% Lenswood Pinot Noir, handpicked, 100% whole bunch, wild-yeast fermentation, one month on skins, only four barrels made, 10 months in 25% new French oak, bottled in December 2017, unfiltered &amp; unfined. Vintage 2015 and 2016 Won the Trophy for BEST Pinot Noir at the Adelaide Hills Wine Shows 2016 and 2017  \n ---------------------------------------------------------------- \n  **Please note vintages may vary from store to store or when delivered**  ",

      "description": " Cantina di Negrar Valpolicella Italy \n Cantina Valpolicella Negrar very proudly the most important and largest organic/bio producer in Valpolicella.  Bright ruby red colour. With an intense red cherry &amp; plum nose. To taste the wine shows black pepper &amp; dark fleshy plum notes with acids &amp; tannins in balance moving to a fresh savoury dried herb finish.  Cantina Negrar is a historic cooperative. Veneto has become Italy’s most productive wine region. The fertile volcanic soil and remnants of river bed strata allow the vines to grow ferociously. In the pursuit of lower yields, and higher quality grapes, the growers at Cantina Negrar have worked to temper the growth by careful trellising, including vertical training and aggressive pruning techniques. Corvina is the star of the region, though it is tricky to master. Its thick skin means it is notoriously late-ripening and requires careful attention and patience through September. Fastidiousness results in its scarlet red colour – a mouthful of lush tart cherry with hints of fresh mint and thyme…like the very name Valpolicella, it just rolls of your tongue!  Cantina Negrar is an exceptional group of growers and winemakers and their commitment to quality is evident. They share the pride and joy of belonging to a cooperative winery staffed by people who love the vines they tend and make the wines they love. In the beautiful Negrar valley there’s a real buzz with younger generations rushing to take up the mantle of best grower/producer.  Corvina is the star of the region, though it is tricky to master.

Sometimes small, and sometimes a little too big. But they still have the Goulburn valley crunch with full pink lady flavour. Perfect for eating and juicing. \n  IMPERFECT PICKS    is our seasonal range of fruit and vegetables that might not look perfect from the outside, but are as perfect as ever on the inside. IMPERFECT PICKS helps reduce the astonishing statistic that 25% of farmers crops currently never leave the farm gate simply because they are a bit ugly, and do not meet the visual specifications of some consumers and supermarkets (Horticulture Australia).This means that every time you buy an IMPERFECT PICK you will be helping us take more of the farmer’s crops, helping reduce food wastage, and most importantly saving up to 50%.

The leaves are tiny and heart shaped, ringed with a splash of yellow. Lemon thyme has a bit of a citrus tang, but is milder than most other thyme. This makes it a natural choice for seasoning seafood dishes and even sweets. The citrus flavour also helps to lighten fatty dishes. The natural, volatile oils also work as a digestive aid. ",

A safe substitute for those who experience wheat sensitivities. Spelt is easily soluble in water allowing nutrients to be efficiently absorbed by our bodies, making it   easy to digest. High in Protein   (significantly higher than conventional wheat) and B complex vitamins, Spelt is packed full of simple and complex carbohydrates. These are both important for blood clotting and stimulating the     body’s immune system  . Spelt is a   superb fibre resource.   You’ll love spelt not just because its nutty flavour tastes so good, but because it is bursting with   so many other nutritional benefits which are amazingly good for you!  \n  INGREDIENTS   \n Certified organic stoneground spelt flour, filtered water, certified organic sunflower oil, psyllium husk, lecithin and Himalayan pink rock salt. \n Kosher (Certified by KAUST) \n  GM &amp; Sulphite-Free  \n We're proud of the fact that we use non-GM ingredients, and all of our ingredients are sulphite-free.

Still nowadays butter is obtained from the best milk or whey cream.   \n  Of course the freshness of this simple ingredient is essential: the less is the time between the cream production and its processing, the less are the required treatments and the better will be the obtained butter. Then the pasteurization and ripening help to refine the organoleptic qualities of the product.   \n  Not only the freshness, but also the cream pasteurization, its multiple washing and the lactic ferments addition are “ingredients” that make the recipe of Soresina unique.   \n  Thanks to the daily milk collection, Latteria Soresina is able to apply this technique with method and knowledge, in order to offer always good products. The block of butter comes from the selection of the best milk and whey cream.  ",

      "description": " Blue Bay Goat Milk Probiotic Kefir Yoghurt \n \n Made with 100% grass fed, certified organic milk NASAA 3793 \n Kefir is fermented milk and an amazing source of probiotics. Blue Bay Kefir, from Mornington, Victoria is an Australian gold award-winning brand and is made from premium organic milk, has no added thickeners or preservatives and best of all it tastes divine! \n  While kefir is great to consume on its own daily, cooking and preparing food with kefir is also versatile and easy. Just store it upright in the fridge so the fat cap stays in place. Because it is acidic it can be used in recipes where cultured buttermilk is called for. The lactic acid activates baking soda, making for fluffy pancakes. It is perfect blended with ice and fruit – and perhaps a little honey – to make a delicious smoothie. Because it has a subtle savoury flavour it actually makes superb dressings: fold through some olive oil, salt and a little garlic and used to dress a salad or pour over BBQ lamb.  \n \n \n  \n \n ",

      "description": " Hazeldenes Chicken Diced Free Range \n  Our Fresh Chicken Products  \n Hazeldene’s produce some of the best poultry in this country. With a really strong focus on quality, our stock is sought after by the major supermarkets, butchers, charcoal chicken shops, smaller retailers, and wholesalers. We were the first poultry producer in the southern hemisphere to implement Aeroscalding – a process prior to plucking that retains all skin layers, reduces cross contamination and microbiological load, and results in better tasting chicken. We were also among the first to implement Air Chilling, a process we are strongly committed to – which reduces the moisture content in poultry, meaning you pay for protein not water – and it has a much better shelf life than those who exclusively deep water chill. \n Find out more about Hazeldenes Chicken   here .  \n Looking for some inspiration for dinner tonight, then head over to our     recipes page  . \n \n  \n  \n  \n ",

Approximately 40-50 pieces per kg.  \n  Kinkawooka Mussels are grown in the Mediterranean style to be small, soft and sweet. Unlike big oceanic mussels from open water farming, the true quality of the Bay grown mussel lies in it;s eating quality. At the start of the season in June, Kinkawooka mussels are typically “petit” with 60-70 pieces per kilo and a meat to shell ratio of nearly 50%. As the harvest year continues, the mussels grow in size to 30-35 pieces per kilo  by  March. The Quality Control system operated by Kinkawooka Mussels ensure that the meat to shell ratio remains high throughout the season, but importantly that there is ALWAYS an excellent eating mussel.  ",

Unlike big oceanic mussels from open water farming, the true quality of the Bay grown mussel lies in it;s eating quality. At the start of the season in June, Kinkawooka mussels are typically “petit” with 60-70 pieces per kilo and a meat to shell ratio of nearly 50%. As the harvest year continues, the mussels grow in size to 30-35 pieces per kilo  by  March. The Quality Control system operated by Kinkawooka Mussels ensure that the meat to shell ratio remains high throughout the season, but importantly that there is ALWAYS an excellent eating mussel.  ",

Whole bunch pressed to tank for cold settling and then racked and fermented slowly to retain fresh fruit characters. The finished wine is almost completely dry, relying on the texture and the quality of the fruit to carry the palate.  The aromatics of Pinot Gris are gentle, lifted florals, pears and spice. The palate is rich and textural, as Pinot Gris should be, with hints of spice on the finish. Texture is an important character for Pinot Gris building from great fruit quality and attention to balance during winemaking.  As always with Bilancia Pinot Gris, enjoy on release but also be rewarded after a few years cellaring. This wine should hold well for 4 – 6 years.

Natural wines can be considered more of a concept as opposed to a strict set of rules and regulations in Australia. It’s not new, it is actually extremely old! Essentially, it is taking unadulterated grape juice and letting it ferment in its natural state, just as was done in centuries past. The concept is very little winemaking interference which can include, no added yeast, often handpicked grapes, no spraying or herbicides, no additives like oak flavour and no fining agents or acid. Also, the philosophy includes little to no sulphur (preservative) addition or at least a very small amount compared to conventional wine making amongst many other winemaking points. Some people think conventional wines and the liberal use of sulphur is like a snapshot of a wine in time and can make the wine a bit “dead.” The natural wines have plenty of personality and liveliness to them. Some are a bit more alternative like letting white wines ferment on skins giving both colour and texture or the use of lesser known varieties like Zibbibo or a wild mix of many varieties not often seen together.   Why is it a discussion ? Natural wines have been emerging as a “new” thing over the past few years. To be honest, our Harris Farm sommelier, has been hesitant to bring them in stores as there have been some arguably faulty wines out there under the guise of the “natural wine” movement umbrella. However, these wines have been getting better and better and with a fine-tuned palate especially used to vet on your behalf, we’ve been finding some pretty e...",

      "description": " Chateau Belloy - Red Bordeaux Canon Fronsac - Bordeaux France \n  The story:  Les Canons du Château Belloy is a wine that pays homage, by its spicy side to the frigates which, sailing on the Dordogne in the 14th - 15th century, used the Belloy hill, very close to the Dordogne, as a target to adjust the range of their Canons.   Vinification:  Fermentation in concrete vats   Located on the right Bank of Bordeaux region, the Canon-Fronsac appellation is nicknamed ‘secret garden of Bordeaux’ by Duc de Richelieu. The Travers family took over Château Belloy in the 18th Century. The Château has had various noble owners in the past and its vineyards have been renowned for their quality since 1735. Nowadays Château Belloy is recognized as one of the leading wine amongst the Canon-Fronsac appellation.   Tasting note:  This third wine from Château Belloy naturally presents a spicy side due to the presence in greater quantity of Cabernet Franc. The Merlot ensures the aromatic balance with notes of red fruit.   Annual quantity : 15,000 to 18,000 bottles  \n ---------------------------------------------------------------- \n  **Please note vintages may vary from store to store or when delivered**  ",

Their complex bouquet is usually dominated by black fruit aromas with a touch of minerality and well-integrated, elegant oak. Often somewhat \"virile\" when young, the wines gain in balance and complexity with age. They are fresh, straightforward, and have a wonderful length. \n Château Sociando-Mallet has always been a wine with great ageing potential. A wine to be enjoyed even after 30 years in great vintages. \n  The Vineyard and its terroir  \n \n Sociando-Mallet has throned on the Butte de Baleyron, one of the finest gravelly terroirs in the Médoc, since the 17th century. Situated in the commune of Saint-Seurin-de-Cadourne, north of Pauillac, the vineyard overlooks the Gironde estuary on a bend in the river. \n Sociando-Mallet's terroir consists of Günz gravel over a deep layer of clay-limestone soil. This terroir perfectly regulates water supply and enables Cabernet Sauvignon to ripen extremely well and Merlot to acquire depth and complexity. This terroir is Sociando's soul. It provides the wine with complex structure, freshness, and elegance. \n ---------------------------------------------------------------- \n  **Please note vintages may vary from store to store or when delivered**  \n \n ",

Natural wines can be considered more of a concept as opposed to a strict set of rules and regulations in Australia. It’s not new, it is actually extremely old! Essentially, it is taking unadulterated grape juice and letting it ferment in its natural state, just as was done in centuries past. The concept is very little winemaking interference which can include, no added yeast, often handpicked grapes, no spraying or herbicides, no additives like oak flavour and no fining agents or acid. Also, the philosophy includes little to no sulphur (preservative) addition or at least a very small amount compared to conventional wine making amongst many other winemaking points. Some people think conventional wines and the liberal use of sulphur is like a snapshot of a wine in time and can make the wine a bit “dead.” The natural wines have plenty of personality and liveliness to them. Some are a bit more alternative like letting white wines ferment on skins giving both colour and texture or the use of lesser known varieties like Zibbibo or a wild mix of many varieties not often seen together.   Why is it a discussion ? Natural wines have been emerging as a “new” thing over the past few years. To be honest, our Harris Farm sommelier, has been hesitant to bring them in stores as there have been some arguably faulty wines out there under the guise of the “natural wine” movement umbrella. However, these wines have been getting better and better and with a fine-tuned palate especially used to vet on your behalf, we’ve been finding some pretty exciting stuff! We are still ...",

Clean Water Daily   One of the best tips for getting the most enjoyment out of your flowers is to change the water daily with fresh, cold water. The water should look good enough to drink!   To ensure the water stays clean, remove any leaves or foliage from the stems that fall under the waterline of the vase.    3. Use the Flower Food   Drop in the supplied flower food into your vase and follow the instructions on the packet (this helps your flowers last longer). If you need to make your own or run out, you can replicate at home by adding a couple of drops of bleach and a pinch of sugar to fresh water.    4.
